# How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called?
# How can you find an object's ancestors?

# Answer: use the #ancestors method.
# Example: Orange.ancestors

  module Taste
    def flavor(flavor)
      puts "#{flavor}"
    end
  end

  class Orange
    include Taste
  end

  class HotSauce
    include Taste
  end

  # What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?
  # Answer:
  # HotSauce/Orange
  # Taste
  # Object
  # Kernel
  # BasicObject

# LS:
# The list of ancestor classes is also called a lookup chain, because Ruby will
# look for a method starting in the first class in the chain (in this case
# HotSauce) and eventually lookup BasicObject if the method is found nowhere in
# the lookup chain.

#   If the method appears nowhere in the chain then Ruby will raise a
#   NoMethodError which will tell you a matching method can not be found
#   anywhere in the chain.

#   Keep in mind this is a class method and it will not work if you call this
#   method on an instance of a class (unless of course that instance has a
#   method called ancestors).
