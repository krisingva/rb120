# If we have this class:

class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end

# What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in
# mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the
# Bingo class inherits from.

# Answer: If we call the `play` method on an instance of `Bingo` class, the `Bingo` class `play` method would override the one in `Game` class.
