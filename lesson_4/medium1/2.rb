# Alan created the following code to keep track of items for a shopping cart
# application he's writing:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end

# Alyssa looked at the code and spotted a mistake. "This will fail when
# update_quantity is called", she says.

# Can you spot the mistake and how to address it?

# Answer: There is no setter method for `quantity` so `quantity = updated_count`
# will just initialize a new local variable `quantity` and set it to
# `updated_count`
# Fix: Add a writer for quantity:
# `attr_writer :quantity`

# Forgot: Have to also add `self.` in front of setter method when called, see LS

# LS:
# The problem is that since quantity is an instance variable, it must be
# accessed with the @quantity notation when setting it. Even though attr_reader
# is defined for quantity, the fact that it's a reader means that there is
# implicitly a method for retrieving the value (a "getter") but the setter is
# undefined. So there are two possible solutions:

# change attr_reader to attr_accessor, and then use the "setter" method like
# this: self.quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0. reference the
# instance variable directly within the update_quantity method, like this
# @quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
