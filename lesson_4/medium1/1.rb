# Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end

# Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that
# you forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance
# variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

# "Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an
# @!"

# Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

# Answer: Ben, since there is a getter method for `balance` via `attr_reader
# :balance`

# LS:
# Ben is right because of the fact that he added an attr_reader for the balance
# instance variable. This means that Ruby will automatically create a method
# called balance that returns the value of the @balance instance variable. The
# body of the positive_balance? method will evaluate to calling the balance
# method of the class, which will return the value of the @balance instance
# variable. If Ben had omitted the attr_reader (or had used an attr_writer
# rather than a reader or accessor) then Alyssa would be right.
