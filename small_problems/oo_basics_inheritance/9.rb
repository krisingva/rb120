# Method Lookup (Part 3)
# Using the following code, determine the lookup path used when invoking
# bird1.color. Only list the classes or modules that were checked by Ruby when
# searching for the #color method.

module Flyable
  def fly
    "I'm flying!"
  end
end

class Animal
  attr_reader :color

  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
  include Flyable
end

bird1 = Bird.new('Red')
bird1.color

# Answer:
# Bird
# Flyable
# Animal

# Discussion
# This exercise is similar to the previous one, however, now the module Flyable
# has been mixed-in. How does that affect the lookup path? When a module is
# included in a class, the class is searched before the module. But, the module
# is searched before the superclass. This order of precedence applies to all
# modules and classes in the inheritance hierarchy.
