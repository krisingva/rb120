# Method Lookup (Part 1)
# Using the following code, determine the lookup path used when invoking
# cat1.color. Only list the classes that were checked by Ruby when searching for
# the #color method.

class Animal
  attr_reader :color

  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
end

cat1 = Cat.new('Black')
cat1.color

# Answer:
# Cat
# Animal

# When a method is invoked, Ruby searches the method's class for the specified
# method. If no method is found, then Ruby inspects the class's superclass. This
# process is repeated until the method is found or there are no more classes.

# To find the lookup path for a class, simply invoke #ancestors on the class.
# This method returns an array containing the names of the classes in the lookup
# path, based on the order in which they're checked.
