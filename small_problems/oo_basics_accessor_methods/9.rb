# Calculated Age
# Using the following code, multiply @age by 2 upon assignment, then multiply
# @age by 2 again when @age is returned by the getter method.

# class Person
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.age = 20
# puts person1.age

class Person
  def age
    @age * 2
  end

  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age * 2
  end
end


person1 = Person.new
person1.age = 20
puts person1.age


# Expected output:

# 80

# class Person

#   def age
#     @age * 2

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.age = 20
# puts person1.age

# Discussion
# Performing calculations in accessor methods can be convenient if that's the
# only place you need the calculation to be performed. In the solution, we
# manually implement both the setter and getter method. In both methods, we
# multiply the specified value by 2. Pretty straightforward.

# Calculations like these aren't always solely done in accessor methods,
# however. We can easily implement these calculations both inside the accessor
# methods and outside by creating a new method, like this:

# class Person
#   def age=(age)
#     @age = double(age)
#   end

#   def age
#     double(@age)
#   end

#   private

#   def double(value)
#     value * 2
#   end
# end

# By structuring our class this way, we can double a given value anywhere we
# want. Notice, also, that we placed double below private. Due to the
# calculations all being inside the class, we can restrict access to double from
# outside the class.
