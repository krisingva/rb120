# Discussion
# When adding getters and setters, it's easy to get carried away and simply add
# #attr_accessor for every instance variable. However, doing this can have
# negative implications. In the initial example, #attr_accessor is used for
# @phone_number. This means that @phone_number can be modified from outside the
# class, which we don't want.

# We need to ensure that @phone_number can only be modified from within the
# class. To do this, we simply need to remove the setter method by changing
# #attr_accessor to #attr_reader. This still lets us provide a phone number when
# instantiating the object, but doesn't let us modify it from outside the class.
