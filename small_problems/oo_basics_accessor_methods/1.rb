# Reading and Writing
# Add the appropriate accessor methods to the following code.

# class Person
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'Jessica'
# puts person1.name

class Person
  attr_accessor :name
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.name = 'Jessica'
puts person1.name

# Expected output:

# Jessica

# LS:
# Solution
# class Person
#   attr_writer :name
#   attr_reader :name
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'Jessica'
# puts person1.name

# Discussion
# To access an object's instance variables from outside the object, we need to
# invoke an accessor method. In the initial example, after the instantiation of
# person1, we invoke a method named name=. Due to Ruby's syntactical sugar, the
# method invocation looks like this:

# person1.name = 'Jessica'
# Without Ruby's syntactical sugar, it looks like this:

# person1.name=('Jessica')
# We can manually implement #name= inside the Person class, like so:

# class Person
#   def name=(value)
#     @name = value
#   end
# end
# However, using accessor methods is so common in Ruby that there's a built in
# way to quickly create them.

# class Person
#   attr_writer :name
# end
# #attr_writer is a simpler way of implementing #name=. This not only applies to
# setter methods, like #name=, but to getter methods as well by using
# #attr_reader.

# You can also use #attr_accessor instead of specifying both #attr_reader and
# #attr_writer. This is examined in more detail in the next exercise.
