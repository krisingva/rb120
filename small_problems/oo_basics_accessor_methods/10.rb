# Unexpected Change
# Modify the following code to accept a string containing a first and last name.
# The name should be split into two instance variables in the setter method,
# then joined in the getter method to form a full name.

# class Person
#   attr_accessor :name
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'John Doe'
# puts person1.name

class Person
  # attr_accessor :name

  def name
    @first_name + " " + @last_name
  end

  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
    @first_name, @last_name = @name.split[0], @name.split[1]
  end
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.name = 'John Doe'
puts person1.name

# Expected output:

# John Doe

# LS:

# Solution
# class Person
#   def name=(name)
#     @first_name, @last_name = name.split(' ')
#   end

#   def name
#     "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'John Doe'
# puts person1.name

# Discussion
# When writing the accessor method for a class, it can be difficult to plan for
# change. Sometimes, when you first create the class, no extra functionality is
# needed. Then, later on, the method needs to do something extra. In this case,
# we had a single accessor method, but now we need to manually write both the
# setter and getter method, to incorporate the requested functionality.

# Starting with the setter method, we're still only dealing with one argument.
# However, we know that the argument is a string that has two names, first and
# last, that are separated by a single space. The goal is to create two instance
# variables: @first_name and @last_name. We can accomplish this by using the
# #split method to separate each name and assign them to the appropriate
# variable.

# As for the getter method, we can't just return @name because that instance
# variable doesn't exist. Instead, we have two variables that we need to combine
# into a full name. We do this simply by adding both variables to a string,
# separated by a space, and returning that string.
