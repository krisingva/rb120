# Avoid Mutation
# The following code is flawed. It currently allows @name to be modified from
# outside the method via a destructive method call. Fix the code so that it
# returns a copy of @name instead of a reference to it.

# class Person
#   attr_reader :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new('James')
# person1.name.reverse!
# puts person1.name

class Person
  # attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name.dup
  end
end

person1 = Person.new('James')
person1.name.reverse!
puts person1.name

# Expected output:

# James

# Discussion
# In the initial example, @name was modified through the invocation of a
# destructive method. This is because getter methods typically return a
# reference to the instance variable. If you use this reference to mutate the
# return value, you also mutate the instance variable.

# To prevent this, we can invoke the #clone method on @name, which returns a
# copy of @name instead of a reference to it. This means that any modifications
# done to the return value won't affect the value of @name. Note that we should
# also remove the attr_reader line since we are providing a customized getter
# method.
