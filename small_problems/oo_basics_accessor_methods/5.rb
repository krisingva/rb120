# Who is Older?
# Using the following code, add the appropriate accessor methods. Keep in mind
# that @age should only be visible to instances of Person.

# class Person
#   def older_than?(other)
#     age > other.age
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.age = 17

# person2 = Person.new
# person2.age = 26

# puts person1.older_than?(person2)

class Person
  attr_writer :age

  def older_than?(other)
    age > other.age
  end

  protected

  attr_reader :age
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.age = 17

person2 = Person.new
person2.age = 26

puts person1.older_than?(person2)

# Discussion
# In the previous exercise, we worked with the private accessor methods. Using a
# private method helped us control access to specific instance variables.
# Similarly, we can also control access through protected accessor methods.

# To make a method protected, simply implement it following the reserved word
# protected, like this:

# class Person
#   protected

#   attr_reader :age
# end

# When a method is private, only the class - not instances of the class - can
# access it. However, when a method is protected, only instances of the class or
# a subclass can call the method. This means we can easily share sensitive data
# between instances of the same class type.

# In the solution, we implement a method that compares the ages of two people.
# The getter method is protected, though, which means we can only access it from
# an instance of the same class. Therefore, we have to invoke older_than? on an
# existing instance, and pass in another instance as an argument. We can then
# compare the two ages to determine who is older.
