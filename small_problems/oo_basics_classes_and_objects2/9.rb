# Private Secret
# Using the following code, add a method named share_secret that prints the
# value of @secret when invoked.

class Person
  attr_writer :secret

  def share_secret
    puts secret
  end

  private

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
person1.share_secret
# Expected output:

# Shh.. this is a secret!

# Discussion
# Sometimes, certain instance methods don't need to be accessed outside the
# class. Therefore, it's better to make them private methods, which means they
# can only be invoked from within the class. We can make certain methods private
# by placing the reserved word private before the method definition.

# We can invoke a private method from within the class just like we would with
# any other method. The important thing to realize here is that private methods
# can't be invoked from outside the class, like this:

# class Person
#   attr_writer :secret

#   private

#   attr_reader :secret
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
# person1.secret # => private method `secret' called for #<Person:0x007fef1986ac08 @secret="Shh.. this is a secret!"> (NoMethodError)
# We get a NoMethodError because secret is a private getter method.
