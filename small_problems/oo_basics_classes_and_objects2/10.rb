# Protected Secret
# Using the following code, add an instance method named compare_secret that
# compares the value of @secret from person1 with the value of @secret from
# person2.

class Person
  attr_writer :secret

  def compare_secret(object)
    self.secret == object.secret
  end

  protected

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'

person2 = Person.new
person2.secret = 'Shh.. this is a different secret!'

puts person1.compare_secret(person2)
# Expected output:

# false

# LS:
# Solution
# class Person
#   attr_writer :secret

#   def compare_secret(other_person)
#     secret == other_person.secret
#   end

#   protected

#   attr_reader :secret
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'

# person2 = Person.new
# person2.secret = 'Shh.. this is a different secret!'

# puts person1.compare_secret(person2)

# Discussion
# Protected methods are very similar to private methods. The main difference
# between them is protected methods allow access between class instances, while
# private methods don't. If a method is protected, it can't be invoked from
# outside the class. This allows for controlled access, but wider access between
# class instances.

# In the solution, we pass person2 as an argument into #compare_secret. We then
# compare the value of @secret from person1 with the value of @secret from
# person2. We do this using the == operator which returns a boolean.
