# Hello, Chloe!
# Using the following code, add an instance method named #rename that renames
# kitty when invoked.

class Cat
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # def name=(new_name)
  #   @name = new_name
  # end

  def rename(new_name)
    self.name=(new_name)
    # self.name
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
p kitty.name
kitty.rename('Chloe')
p kitty.name
# Expected output:

# Sophie
# Chloe

# Discussion
# Using a getter method, we can retrieve a value simply by invoking the method.
# To modify a value using a setter method, we need to add additional syntax.
# When invoking setter methods, they must be denoted with self. We're required
# to use self so that Ruby knows the difference between initializing a local
# variable and invoking a setter method.

# In the solution, #rename accepts one argument, which represents a new name. To
# rename kitty, we invoke the setter method for @name and pass new_name as an
# argument.
