# Identify Yourself (Part 1)
# Using the following code, add a method named #identify that returns its
# calling object.

class Cat
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def identify
    self
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
p kitty.identify
# Expected output (yours may contain a different object id):

#<Cat:0x007ffcea0661b8 @name="Sophie">

# LS:
# Discussion
# In the last two exercises, we used self to define class methods and to modify
# instance variables. self is used because it refers to the calling object. This
# means that, in our solution, invoking self is the same as invoking kitty.

# p kitty.identify # => #<Cat:0x007f932b06dba8 @name="Sophie">
# p kitty          # => #<Cat:0x007f932b06dba8 @name="Sophie">
# We use #p to print the object so that #inspect is called, which lets us view
# the instance variables and their values along with the object.
