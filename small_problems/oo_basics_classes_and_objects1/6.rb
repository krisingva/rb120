# Hello, Sophie! (Part 2)
# Using the code from the previous exercise, move the greeting from the
# #initialize method to an instance method named #greet that prints a greeting
# when invoked.

# Code:

class Cat
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{@name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
# Expected output:

# Hello! My name is Sophie!

# Discussion
# Instance methods are written the same as any other method, except they're only
# available when there's an instance of the class. For example, kitty is an
# instance of the Cat class. This means, if we add the #greet method, we're able
# to invoke it, like this:

# kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
# kitty.greet # => Hello! My name is Sophie!
# As mentioned in the previous exercise, the instance variable, @name, can be
# accessed anywhere in the object. This lets us print Hello! My name is Sophie!
# from #greet simply by moving the statement from #initialize to #greet.
