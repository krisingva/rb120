# Hello, Sophie! (Part 1)
# Using the code from the previous exercise, add a parameter to #initialize that
# provides a name for the Cat object. Use an instance variable to print a
# greeting with the provided name. (You can remove the code that displays I'm a
# cat!.)

# Code:

class Cat
  def initialize(n)
    @name = n
    puts "Hello! My name is #{@name}!"

  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
# Expected output:

# Hello! My name is Sophie!

# Discussion
# Instance variables are variables that exist only within an object instance.
# They are available to reference only once the object has been initialized.
# They're differentiated by the @ symbol prepended to their name, like this:
# @name. In this exercise, we use an instance variable to assign a unique name
# to the kitty object.

# To accept arguments upon initialization, we need to add a parameter to
# #initialize. In our solution, we accept one argument, name, and assign it to
# an instance variable named @name. The instance variable is now available to
# reference anywhere inside the object.

# To appease the exercise requirements, we only need to reference @name
# immediately following its initialization. We use #puts to print Hello! My name
# is Sophie. In this object, 'Sophie' is dynamic, which means we used @name to
# print the value. 'Sophie' could just as easily be 'Oliver' if that string was
# passed instead of 'Sophie', like this:

# class Cat
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name # => Oliver
#   end
# end

# kitty = Cat.new('Oliver')
