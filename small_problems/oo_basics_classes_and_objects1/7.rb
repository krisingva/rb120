# Reader
# Using the code from the previous exercise, add a getter method named #name and
# invoke it in place of @name in #greet.

# Code:

class Cat
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
# Expected output:

# Hello! My name is Sophie!

# Discussion
# Getter methods can be written one of two ways. They can be written manually,
# like this:

# class Cat
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def name
#     @name
#   end
# end
# They can also be written using Ruby shorthand, like this:

# class Cat
#   attr_reader :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end
#     Both of these code examples do the exact same thing, however, the second
#     example is preferred due to its simplicity. A getter method not only lets
#     us invoke #name inside the class, like this:

# puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
# but it also lets us invoke #name outside the class via the object:

# kitty.name # => Sophie
