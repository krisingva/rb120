# Writer
# Using the code from the previous exercise, add a setter method named #name.
# Then, rename kitty to 'Luna' and invoke #greet again.

# Code:

class Cat
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name = "Luna"
kitty.greet
# Expected output:

# Hello! My name is Sophie!
# Hello! My name is Luna!

# Discussion
# Setter methods are created similarly to getter methods. Manually, they look
# the same except with an added = in the name and a parameter:

# class Cat
#   attr_reader :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def name=(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end
# Using Ruby shorthand, setter methods are written like this:

# class Cat
#   attr_writer :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end
#     Like getter methods, setter methods can be invoked on the object. In this
#     exercise, we use the setter method to rename kitty. If we invoke #greet on
#     kitty, we'll see that change take effect:

# kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
# kitty.greet # => Hello! My name is Sophie!
# kitty.name = 'Luna'
# kitty.greet # => Hello! My name is Luna!
