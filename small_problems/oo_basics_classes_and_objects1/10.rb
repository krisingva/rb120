# Walk the Cat
# Using the following code, create a module named Walkable that contains a
# method named #walk. This method should print Let's go for a walk! when
# invoked. Include Walkable in Cat and invoke #walk on kitty.

module Walkable
  def walk
    puts "Let's go for a walk!"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.walk
# Expected output:

# Hello! My name is Sophie!
# Let's go for a walk!

# Discussion
# Modules are typically used to contain methods that may be useful for multiple
# classes, but not all classes. When you mix a module into a class, you're
# allowing the class to invoke the contained methods.

# In our solution, we create a module named Walkable that contains a method
# named #walk. We give Cat access to this method by including Walkable in the
# class, like this:

# module Walkable
#   def walk
#     puts "Let's go for a walk!"
#   end
# end

# class Cat
#   include Walkable
# end
#   This lets us invoke #walk on any instance of Cat. In this case, if we invoke
#   kitty.walk, then Let's go for a walk! will be printed.
